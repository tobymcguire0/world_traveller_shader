# World Traveller Project
A unity project to learn how shaders work to build to the final goal of creating multiple worlds in one level. The idea is to have one level that the character can move in, and at the press of a button create a  bubble where everything outside the bubble is the original world, but inside the bubble is a piece of another.


The project makes use of Unity's Universal Render Pipeline / Lightweight Render Pipeline package for the shaders, and Cinemachine for camera movement.
